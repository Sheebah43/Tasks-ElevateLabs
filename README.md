# Task1-ElevateLabs
I am starting the "TaskX-ABC-@ElevateLabs" repository as an initial step towards working with Elevate Labs for my internship. Every assigned task will be uploaded to separate repositories named "TaskX@-ABC-ElevateLabs", where X will be the count of tasks attempted and "ABC" will be replaced by a task title string. This will help me and the hiring team keep track of my performance.
13-11-2025: Task 1: I've managed to create a landing page for a fictional website for a project that I've personally worked on with my teammates in university. I used VSCode and took help from CoPilot in concepts that were new to me.
